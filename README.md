# Artificial Intelligence playing Sonic the hedgehog!
NEAT algorithm (evolutionary artificial neural network) for playing Sonic The Hedgehog 

Requirements to run loose and clean =)

 > Python: https://www.python.org/downloads/

 > NEAT: pip install neat-python https://neat-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html
 
 > Retro API: pip3 install gym-retro https://retro.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html
 
 > Sonic the hedgehog ROM: You need to use a good quality ROM. Most Roms on the web don't work properly, so that, buy the Sonic The Hedgehog rom on Steam (https://store.steampowered.com/app/71113/Sonic_The_Hedgehog/) and then import to Retro files using the following script at PowerShell Script: python -m retro.import /path/to/your/ROMs/directory/

 Good stuff use a Python IDE to run. It's good for coding verification and you just need to press F5 to run. I personally recommend PyCharm, however Spyder or Jupyter also does the job!)
